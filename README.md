# responsive-html5-audio-player
Creating a responsive HTML5 audio player using Bootstrap
1. You need bootstrap framework to run this project, which you will have in the same project folder.
2. You need a server to run this project in chrome based browsers as the music play list is loaded from an external XML file. You may not need it in Firefox and IE.
3. Currently the project has only .mp3 files. You may need .ogg of the same to run in Firefox.
4. Enjoy the source code.
